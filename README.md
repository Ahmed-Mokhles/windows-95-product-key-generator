# windows-95-product-key-generator
will generate valid CD and OEM windows 95 keys.

this generator has very slow performance, as it uses an inefficient implementation written in python, so you probably don't want to use this for batch generation. however, for a one time use of a key, the ~1 minute wait should be fine.
